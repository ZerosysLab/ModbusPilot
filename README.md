## 📖 Introduction
ModbusPilot is a modern debugging tool designed for automation engineers. Built with **.NET 8 (WinForms)**, it moves away from the outdated interfaces of traditional tools, focusing on **"Lightweight Configuration"** and **"Automated Workflows"**.

No need to install massive SCADA systems; you can quickly build device monitoring dashboards with just a few drag-and-drop operations.
